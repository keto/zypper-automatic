## About

The benefits this has over [`yast2-online-update-configuration`](https://github.com/yast/yast-online-update-configuration) is the integration with systemd services/timers and email notifications similar to what's provided in [`dnf-automatic`](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automatic.html) or [`unattended-upgrades`](https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades).

## Builds

Builds are available on OBS at https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:losuler/zypper-automatic.

This repo can be added on supported systems by:

```bash
# openSUSE Tumbleweed
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:losuler/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:losuler.repo
# openSUSE Leap 15.2
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:losuler/openSUSE_Leap_15.2/home:losuler.repo
```

```bash

```

## Config

The configuration file located at `/etc/zypper-automatic.conf` has three main sections. The already filled in values in the examples below are the defaults.

### Zypper

```toml
[zypper]
patch_categories =
with_interactive = false
list_only = false
```

`patch_categories` is a list delimited by commas `,` of patches you'd like to install. Categories include `security`, `recommended`, `optional`, `feature`, `document` and `yast`.<sup>[1]</sup>

`with_interactive` when set to `true` will install "interactive patches, that is, those that need reboot, contain a message, or update a package whose license needs to be confirmed."<sup>[2]</sup>

`list_only` when set to `true` will only send a list of the patches waiting to be installed and will not install them.

### Emitters

```toml
[emitters]
emitter =
emit_on = always
```

The `emitter` refers to one of the message services listed in the subsections below.

The `emit_on` setting defines when the message should be emitted. Valid options are 'always' (the default), 'update' which will trigger only when something actually happens (either an update or an error), and 'error' which will only send notifications when an error occurrs.

#### Email

```toml
[email]
email_to =
```

`email_to` is the email in which to send the notification to. It requires a Sendmail compatible MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) to be setup.

#### Telegram

```toml
[telegram]
token =
chat_id =
```

`token` is the token for the Telegram bot, which is provided by creating a bot by following the steps provided in the [Telegram bot API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).

`chat_id` is the unique identifier for the target chat. It can be obtained by messaging the bot and executing the following command (replace `$BOT_TOKEN`). The ID may be found at `"chat": {"id": 12345678},`:

```sh
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates | python -m json.tool
```
